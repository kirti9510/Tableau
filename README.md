📊 Excited to share my latest Tableau project! 🚀 Recently, I had the opportunity to create a comprehensive dashboard focusing on Covid-19 cases in India. 💡

Throughout the project, I mastered various advanced techniques in Tableau, including:
- Working with multiple data sources (7 files in total) to gather comprehensive insights.
- Harnessing the power of data blending to integrate and analyze diverse datasets seamlessly.
- Utilizing shape files to craft interactive maps that visually represent the spread of Covid-19 across regions.
- Implementing advanced visualization techniques such as measure names and dual axis to create captivating multiple line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts. 📈🗺️

The experience was incredibly rewarding, and I'm thrilled to continue honing my Tableau skills to create impactful visualizations that drive insights and understanding. 💻💬
